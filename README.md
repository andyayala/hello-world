# hello-world
This is just an assignment for class.


Well hello there!
Just to start this assignment I am going to talk a little bit about myself.
My name is Andres Ayala, but I preffer Andy. I have a pet roach which is pretty funny considering how it came into my posession. I love music, tehnology, botany, and animals.
